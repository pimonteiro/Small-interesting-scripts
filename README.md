# Small-interesting-scripts
A bunch of scripts made by me to practice other languages and to ease off workload.

## Scripts
Currently i have the following:
- better-cd


### better-cd
This script allows me to move my working shell directory to another at any level of depth inside the root. It's basically a better version of cd.

#### Installation
Just move it to any directory of your PATH and give it the right permissions:
```sh
chmod +x bcd
```

#### Usage
```sh
bcd <dir>
```
In case of multiple possible options it will ask the user to select one.
