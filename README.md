# Small-interesting-scripts
A bunch of scripts and small games made by me to practice other languages and to ease off workload.

## Scripts
Currently i have the following:
- better-cd
- Game of Life

### better-cd
This script allows me to move my working shell directory to another at any level of depth inside the root. It's basically a better version of cd.

#### Installation
Just move it to any directory of your PATH and give it the right permissions:
```sh
chmod +x bcd
```

#### Usage
```sh
bcd <dir>
```
In case of multiple possible options it will ask the user to select one.

### Game of Life
This small program created [using p5]( https://p5js.org/) lets you see the progression of the famous game "Game of Life", by John Conway.


#### Installation
No instalation required, just run the main program.

#### Usage
Open the index.html on your favourite web browser.
